Build and start your application:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up -d\n   ```\n\n2. Access your application at http://localhost\n\n3. To stop the application:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\nYou can customize the README further by:\n- Adding an actual screenshot of your application\n- Updating the GitHub repository URL\n- Adding your name in the \"Made with ❤️ by\" section\n- Adding any additional features or technologies specific to your implementation\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to explain or modify about the setup?"
